### üë®üèª‚Äçüíª My programming journey

I began my journey in programming at 9 years old, back in 2009, developing minigames in the long-gone ActionScript by
Adobe. Since then, I've never stopped learning. In 2011, I had my first contact with HTML and web development. In 2012,
my father bought me an HTML5 book, and then I began to study HTML5 and CSS.

In 2014, I started my formal education in Computer Science by joining Vocational School. The course took me 3 years (In
Brazil, VET courses normally take 3 years). There, I learned OOP, Java, JavaScript fundamentals, database management,
and collaborated with peers on challenging projects, fostering teamwork and cultivating lifelong friendships.

In my last year of Vocational School, I discovered PHP and was amazed by all the possibilities that it brings with the
ability to serve dynamic content on the web. So, in 2016, I obtained my VET Degree in Computer Science and decided to
continue studying web development on my own.

In 2017, I bought some online web development courses and studied OOP PHP, HTML, and CSS3, now with responsive design
and all the new fun things. I also learned JavaScript in depth, Ajax, and jQuery.

With all this knowledge, I decided it was time to make some money. So, I started a small family Marketing Agency and
sold e-commerce platforms, CMS, Business Websites, and LMS Platforms, all developed in-house.

In the agency, we code and get in touch with clients on a daily basis, and the development cycle was really fast. During
this time, I learned agile and scrum and implemented those strategies with the team.

With the launch of PHP 8 in 2020, I knew it was time to refresh my knowledge. So, I bought an online PHP 8 course and
built my own framework and a CMS on top of it.

After that, I knew it was about time to FINALLY learn Laravel and choose a front-end framework as my go-to. I had to
decide between React and Vue.js, and after seeing the compatibility of Vue with Laravel, the choice became clear to me.
